[h1]DPS Extreme![/h1]
Ever wondered who dealt the most damage to a boss? Ever felt the need to track your Damage Per Second in relation to your friends? Have you ever wanted sweet, sweet looking meters to show off how much your character dominates bosses? Well, you are in luck, as DPSExtreme is now available for use. 

DPSExtreme provides a combat stats meter for use in both multiplayer and singleplayer. 
While fighting, you can see various live stats and compare to your teammates.

Compete with your friends to see who can deal the most damage to bosses as you fight them. For added fun, try challenging bosses with the same weapon and see who can get the most damage in.

[h1]How to Use[/h1]
By default the DPSExtreme window is visible. 
If you wish to toggle the visibility you can either type /teamdps in chat, or go into the Keybindings menu and assign a hotkey.

You (and your friends) also need to have purchased a DPS Meter from the Traveling Merchant.

Click the arrow in the top left to select what stat to display, or click on the text to cycle between them. (Right click cycles backwards)
Click on entries in the list to dive deeper into a breakdown. Here you can see for example what items a player used to deal the damage etc. (Right click to back out)

Once a boss is defeated or an event is completed, a chat message will also report final damage dealt stats.

[h1]Features[/h1]
Tracked stats are:
Damage per second, Damage dealt, Damage taken, Deaths, Kills, Mana Used, (De)buff uptimes, Minion damage done (per minion slot) and enemy damage taken

Here we can see that damage from Traps, Friendly NPCs and debuff DOTs are also accounted for.

Hovering over an entry also brings up a small popup with additional info related to the stat such as hit count, max hit, crit % and average hit damage.

Browse through past combats, or have a look at "All combats" to see who has done the best overall!

[h1]Limitations[/h1]
Debuff DOT tracking in singleplayer is not 100% accurate. The best DPSExtreme can offer is a best-guess estimate based on how quickly enemies are losing health.
